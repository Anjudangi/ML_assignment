    "# 1. Comparing Models with Different Numbers of Predictors\n",
    "# When you have multiple regression models with different numbers of predictors, adjusted R-squared provides a fair comparison by accounting for the number of predictors. This helps in identifying whether adding more predictors actually improves the model or just inflates the R-squared value.\n",

    "# 3. Avoiding Overfitting\n",
    "# Overfitting occurs when a model captures noise in the data rather than the underlying relationship. Adjusted R-squared helps to mitigate this risk by reducing the incentive to add predictors that do not significantly improve the model. This leads to a model that is more likely to generalize well to new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Evaluating Model Improvement\n",
    "# When iteratively adding predictors to a model, adjusted R-squared helps in evaluating whether each new predictor genuinely improves the model.

    "# Same Units as Data: RMSE has the same units as the observed values, making it easier to interpret and understand.\n",
