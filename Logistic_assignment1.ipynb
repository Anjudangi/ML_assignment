    "\n",
    "Chi-Square Test: This test evaluates the independence between categorical features and the target variable. Features with a high chi-square statistic are considered more relevant.\n",
    "Mutual Information: Measures the mutual dependence between the feature and the target variable. Higher mutual information indicates a stronger dependency.\n",
    "ANOVA F-Test: Compares the variances within and between groups. Higher F-statistics indicate more significant features.\n",
    "Wrapper Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): This method recursively removes the least important features and builds the model until the specified number of features is reached. The importance of features is determined based on the model's coefficients.\n",
    "Sequential Feature Selection: This involves adding (forward selection) or removing (backward elimination) features sequentially based on their contribution to the model's performance.\n",
    "Embedded Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso (L1) Regularization: Adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. It can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "Elastic Net Regularization: Combines L1 and L2 penalties to maintain the benefits of both ridge and lasso regularization, promoting group feature selection and handling multicollinearity.\n",
    "Statistical Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "P-Values and Statistical Significance: In logistic regression, features with low p-values are considered significant. Features with high p-values are often dropped from the model.\n",
    "Domain Knowledge and Correlation Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation Matrix: Identifies highly correlated features. One of the features in a highly correlated pair can be removed to reduce multicollinearity.\n",
    "Expert Knowledge: Features can be selected based on domain expertise, which might provide insights into which features are likely to be important.\n",
    "How These Techniques Help Improve Model Performance\n",
    "Reduction of Overfitting: By removing irrelevant or redundant features, the model is less likely to learn from noise in the data, leading to better generalization to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved Interpretability: A model with fewer features is easier to understand and interpret, making it more transparent and explainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduced Computational Cost: Fewer features lead to a decrease in computational resources and time required for training the model, making it more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhanced Model Performance: By focusing on the most relevant features, the model can achieve higher accuracy, precision, and recall. This is because the signal-to-noise ratio is improved, and the model can make better predictions."
