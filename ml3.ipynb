    "To determine how many principal components to retain for feature extraction using PCA, consider the cumulative explained variance. For this example, retaining 4 components captures approximately 98% of the variance, which is generally sufficient for most applications. This approach balances the reduction in dimensionality with the retention of significant information.\n",
